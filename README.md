# meta-analysis :dna:

A meta-analysis of the *FokI*, *BsmI*, *ApaI* and *TaqI* variants of the VDR gene was performed in this project. 
The project was written in Polish because it was based on the needs of the subject at the university.
In the future we will write it in English for a better reception.

We suggest opening the project in Google Colaboratory for a better experience.
